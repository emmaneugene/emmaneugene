# About me
- 👀 I’m interested in systems, programming languages, compilers, hardware and anything else that touches on low-level concepts

- 🔍 More information on my [personal website](https://emmaneugene.github.io)

# Project log
Ideas that may or may not see the light of day:

- Following the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) textbook to learn more about programming language implementations

- Setting up self-hosted services on a personal server

- [Linux from Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)

- A habit-tracking bot on Telegram

- [Feed Integrator](https://github.com/emmaneugene/feed-integrator) as full-stack development practice

- A self-hosted LLM fed on PDFs, e-books, and saved articles for personal knowledge management
