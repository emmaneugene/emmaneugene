# About me
- 👋 I’m a software engineer reading Computer Science at [SMU](https://scis.smu.edu.sg)

- 👀 I’m interested in systems, programming language design and implementation, compilers, and anything else that touches on low-level concepts

- 🔍 More information on my [personal website](https://emmaneugene.github.io)

# Project log
A laundry list of ideas that may or may not see the light of day:

- Following the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) textbook to learn more about programming language implementations

- Setting up self-hosted services on a personal server

- [Linux from Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)

- A simple habit tracker bot on Telegram

- [Feed Integrator](https://github.com/emmaneugene/feed-integrator) as full-stack development practice

- A self-hosted LLM (most likely using the [LLaMa](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) model) for personal knowledge management
